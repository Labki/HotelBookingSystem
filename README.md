This project is my final thesis project for the Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science – Specialization in Programming, completed at AAB College.
It is a fully functional Hotel Booking Management System developed with ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server.

The system provides:

🏨 Room management (CRUD operations, availability tracking)

📅 Booking management with status flow (Pending → Confirmed → Completed/Cancelled)

👤 User authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Core Identity

🛠️ Admin dashboard with statistics, latest bookings, and a visual booking calendar

🔍 Filtering and sorting for bookings (by room, status, and multiple sorting options)

This project demonstrates strong skills in full-stack web development, database design, software architecture, and professional coding practices aligned with academic requirements.
